Introduction
============

**Carculator** is a parametrized model that allows to generate and characterize life cycle inventories for 112 different
passenger car configurations, according to selected:

* powertrain technologies (8): petrol engine, diesel engine, electric motor, hybrid, etc.,
* year of operation (2): 2017, 2040
* and sizes (7): Mini, Large, etc.

It is initially based on the model developed in `Uncertain environmental footprint of current and future battery electric
vehicles by Cox, et al (2018) <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b00261>`_.

More specifically, **Carculator** generates Brightway2- and Simapro-compatible inventories, but also directly provides characterized
results against several mid- and endpoint indicators (e.g., ReCiPe, Ecological Scarcity) and life cycle cost indicators.

Why?
----
Many life cycle assessment models of passenger cars exist, often leading to varying conclusions being published.
Unfortunately, because the underlying calculations are kept undocumented, it is not possible to explain the disparity
in the results given by these models.

Because **Carculator** is kept as open as possible, the methods and assumptions behind the generation of results are easily identifiable.
Also, there is an effort to keep the different modules (classes) separated, so that improving certain areas of the model is relatively
easy and does not require changing extensive parts of the code. In that regard, contributions are welcome.

Finally, beside being more flexible and transparent, **Carculator** provides interesting features, such as:

* a stochastic mode, that allows fast Monte Carlo analyses (1,000 iterations in 22 seconds, on a computer equipped with an i5 CPU)
* possibility to override any or all of the 200+ default car parameters (e.g., number of passengers, drag coefficient)
* hot pollutants emissions function of driving cycle, using HBEFA 3.3 data, further divided between rural, suburban and urban areas
* noise emissions, based on `CNOSSOS-EU <https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/reference-reports/common-noise-assessment-methods-europe-cnossos-eu>`_ models for noise emissions and `Noise footprint from personal land‚Äêbased mobility by Cucurachi, et al (2019) <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jiec.12837>`_ for inventory modelling and mid- and endpoint characterization of noise emissions, function of driving cycle and further divided between rural, suburban and urban areas
* exports inventories as csv files to be used with Brightway2 or Simapro (in progress), including uncertainty information. This requires
the user to have `ecoinvent 3.5 cutoff` installed on the LCA software the car inventories are exported to.
* exports inventories directly into Brightway2, as a database object to be registered. Additionally, when run in stochastic mode,
it is possible to export arrays of pre-sampled values using the `presamples <https://pypi.org/project/presamples/>`_ library
to be used together with the Monte Carlo function of Brightway2.

Objective
---------

The objective is to produce life cycle inventories for passenger cars in a transparent and comprehensive way,
to be further used in prospective life cycle assessment of transportation technologies.

How to install this package?
----------------------------

**Carculator** is a Python package, and is primarily to be used from within a Python 3.x environment.
Because **Carculator** is still at an early development stage, it is a good idea to install it in a separate environment,
such as a conda environment::

    conda create -n <name of the environment> python=3.7

Once your environment created, you should activate it::

    conda activate <name of the environment>

And install the development version of the **Carculator** package in your new environment via Conda::

    conda install -c conda-forge -c pascallesage -c cmutel -c romainsacchi/label/nightly carculator-dev

This will install the package and the required dependencies.


How to use it?
--------------

Static vs. Stochastic mode
**************************

The inventories can be calculated using the most likely value of the given parameters, but also using a probability distribution
for those. For example, the drivetrain efficiency of SUVs, regardless of the powertrain, is given the most likely value of 0.38,
but with a triangular probability distribution with a minimum and maximum of 0.3 and 0.4, respectively.

Creating car models in static mode will use the most likely value of the given parameters to dimension the cars, etc., such as::

   from carculator import *
   cip = CarInputParameters()
   cip.static()
   dcts, array = fill_xarray_from_input_parameters(cip)
   cm = CarModel(array)
   cm.set_all()


Alternatively, if one wishes to work with probability distributions as parameter values instead::

    from carculator import *
    cip = CarInputParameters()
    cip.stochastic(800)
    dcts, array = fill_xarray_from_input_parameters(cip)
    cm = CarModel(array)
    cm.set_all()


This effectively creates 800 iterations of the same car models, picking pseudo-random value for the given parameters,
within the probability distributions defined. This allows to assess later the effect of uncertainty propagation on
characterized results.

In both case, a CarModel object is returned, with a 3-dimensional array `array` to store the generated parameters values, with the following dimensions:

0. Vehicle size, e.g. "small", "medium". str.
1. Powertrain, e.g. "ICE-p", "BEV". str.
2. Year. int.
3. Values. float


`cm.set_all()` generates a CarModel object and calculate the energy consumption, components mass, as well as
exhaust and non-exhaust emissions for all vehicle profiles.


Accessing attributes of the car model
*************************************
Hence, the tank-to-wheel energy requirement per km driven per powertrain technology for a SUV in 2017 can be obtained
from the CarModel object::

    TtW_energy = cm.array.sel(size='SUV', year=2017, parameter='TtW energy', value=0) * 1/3600 * 100

    plt.bar(TtW_energy.powertrain, TtW_energy)
    plt.ylabel('kWh/100 km')
    plt.show()

Note that if you had run the model in stochastic mode, you would have several values stored for a given calculated parameter
in the array. The number of values correspond to the number of iterations you passed to cip.stochastic().

For example, if you ran the model in stochastic mode with 800 iterations as shown in the section above, instead of one
value for the tank-to-wheel energy, you would have a distribution of values::

    l_powertrains = TtW_energy.powertrain
    [plt.hist(e, bins=50, alpha=.8, label=e.powertrain.values) for e in TtW_energy]
    plt.ylabel('kWh/100 km')
    plt.legend()

Any other attributes of the CarModel class can be obtained in a similar way. For example, all calculated parameters that start with
`_lci` are inputs or outputs to the inventory.
Hence, the following lists all direct exhaust emissions included in the inventory of an petrol Van in 2017:

List of all the given and calculated parameters of the car model::

    list_param = cm.array.coords['parameter'].values.tolist()

Return the parameters concerned with direct exhaust emissions (we remove noise emissions)::

    direct_emissions = [x for x in list_param if x.startswith('_lci_direct_') and 'noise' not in x]

Finally, return their values and display the first 10 in a table::

    cm.array.sel(parameter=direct_emissions, year=2017, size='Van', powertrain='BEV').to_dataframe(name='direct emissions')

Or we could be interested in visualizing the distribution of non-characterized noise emissions, in joules::

    noise_emissions = [x for x in list_param if 'noise' in x]
    data = cm.array.sel(parameter=noise_emissions, year=2017, size='Van', powertrain='ICEV-p', value=0)\
        .to_dataframe(name='noise emissions')['noise emissions']
    data[data>0].plot(kind='bar')
    plt.ylabel('joules per km')
