ISO 14040:2006 covers life cycle assessment (LCA) studies and life cycle inventory (LCI) studies. It does not describe the LCA technique in detail, nor does it specify methodologies for the individual phases of the LCA. The intended application of LCA or LCI results is considered during definition of the goal and scope, but the application itself is outside the scope of this International Standard.},

@article{Bauer2015,
abstract = {This paper contains an evaluation of the environmental performance of a comprehensive set of current and future mid-size passenger vehicles. We present a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) based on a novel integrated vehicle simulation framework, which allows for consistency in vehicle parameter settings and consideration of future technological progress. Conventional and hybrid gasoline, diesel and natural gas cars as well as battery and fuel cell electric vehicles (BEV and FCV) are analyzed, taking into account electricity and hydrogen production chains from fossil, nuclear and renewable energy resources.Our results show that a substantial mitigation of climate change can be obtained with electric passenger vehicles, provided that non-fossil energy resources are used for electricity and hydrogen production. However, in terms of other environmental burdens such as acidification, particulate matter formation, and toxicity, BEV may in some cases and FCV are likely to perform worse than modern fossil fueled cars as a consequence of emissions along vehicle and fuel production chains. Therefore, the electrification of road transportation should be accompanied by an integration of life cycle management in vehicle manufacturing chains as well as energy and transport policies in order to counter potential environmental drawbacks.},

@article{Helmers2017,
abstract = {Concerns over climate change, air pollution, and oil supply have stimulated the market for battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The environmental impacts of BEVs are typically evaluated through a standardized life-cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Here, the LCA literature was surveyed with the objective to sketch the major trends and challenges in the impact assessment of BEVs. It was found that BEVs tend to be more energy ef cient and less polluting than conventional cars. BEVs decrease exposure to air pollution as their impacts largely result from vehicle produc- tion and electricity generation outside of urban areas. The carbon footprint of BEVs, being highly sensitive to the carbon intensity of the electricity mix, may decrease in the nearby future through a shift to renewable energies and technology improvements in general. A minority of LCAs cov- ers impact categories other than carbon footprint, revealing a mixed picture. There has been little attention paid so far in LCA to the ef ciency advantage of BEVs in urban traf c, the gap between on-road and certi ed energy consumption, the local exposure to air pollutants and noise and the aging of emissions control technologies in conventional cars. Improvements of BEV components, directed charging, second-life reuse of vehicle batteries, as well as vehicle-to-home and vehicle- to-grid applications will signi cantly reduce the environmental impacts of BEVs in the future},

abstract = {Dieser Artikel vergleicht aufgrund offizieller Messdaten zwei Mittelklasseautos, den Mercedes C 220 d und den neuen Tesla Model 3, bez{\"{u}}glich ihres Verbrauchs an Diesel bzw. Strom. Dabei werden alternative marginale Energiequellen f{\"{u}}r den Strom sowie der tat-s{\"{a}}chliche Strommix Deutschlands aus dem Jahr 2018 zugrunde gelegt. Ferner wird eine Metastudie f{\"{u}}r den CO 2-Aussto{\ss} bei der Batteriefertigung ber{\"{u}}cksichtigt. Es zeigt sich, dass der CO 2-Aussto{\ss} des Elektromotors im g{\"{u}}nstigen Fall um etwa ein Zehntel und im ung{\"{u}}ns-tigen Fall um ein gutes Viertel {\"{u}}ber dem Aussto{\ss} des Dieselmotors liegt. Am g{\"{u}}nstigsten ist der mit Methan betriebene Verbrennungsmotor, der auch dann, wenn man die erhebli-che Vorkettenverschmutzung beim Methan ber{\"{u}}cksichtigt, um ein knappes Drittel unter dem Dieselmotor liegt. Auf die Wasserstoff-Methan-Technologie zu setzen, hat zwei Vor-teile. Zum einen ist sie langfristig der einzig funktionierende Weg zur Speicherung der {\"{u}}berschie{\ss}enden Stromspitzen des Wind-und Sonnenstroms, die erforderlich ist, wenn die Marktanteile dieser Form regenerativen Stroms ausgeweitet werden sollen. Zum anderen bietet sie schon aus dem Stand heraus die M{\"{o}}glichkeit einer erheblichen CO 2-Einsparung, selbst wenn dieses Methan aus fossilen Quellen stammt.},

abstract = {Brightway is an open source framework for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) calculations in Python. The combination of a modular structure, the expressiveness and interactivity of Python and in particular Jupyter notebooks, and tuned calculation pathways allows for new research directions in Life Cycle Assessment. Brightway has been used in papers on meta-analysis of many inventory datasets (Wernet et al. 2011), regionalized LCA (Mutel, Pfister, and Hellweg 2011), and sensitivity analysis (Mutel, Baan, and Hellweg 2013). Brightway consists of three main modules: Brightway2-data (Mutel 2012c) manages how data is stored and accessed; Brightway2-calc (Mutel 2012b) does static and Monte Carlo calculations; and Brightway2-IO (Mutel 2015c) handles the import and export of LCA data from various sources. In addition to these libraries, helper libraries provide documentation and application examples (Mutel 2012a), support for parameterized inventories (Mutel 2015b), and a format for LCA data in arrays (Mutel 2013). A web page (Mutel 2016), documentation (Mutel 2015a), and a development blog (Mutel 2014) are also available.},
